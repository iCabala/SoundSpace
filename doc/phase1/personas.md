**Alice** is a third-year student who has one of the head positions in one of the most social clubs in her university. 
Every so often, she is in charge of organizing parties for the club members. She is very outgoing but also very
empathetic so she knows that some of the more introverted members are sometimes left out. Her objectives are to 
find ways in which they can feel like they can share things like their taste in music without putting them on the
spot.

**Brandon** is in charge of a small development team that is works in a small office space that they rented downtown.
He has a major in Computer Science and a minor in Psychology and strongly believes that a friendly working environment
is key in developing quality software. Due to the limited space available in the office, everyone can listen to the
song that is currently being played in the speakers will be heard by the entire team. His objectives are finding ways
to queue up the songs in a particular order such that everyone has a turn to play their style of songs without there
being arguments on "who gets to pick the next song".

**Fred** is a middle aged man that loves the outdoors and likes to go on camping trips with his friends. In order to save
money from gasoline, he usually takes all of his friends in his RV. Fred doesn't particularly enjoy the road trip 
because he can be very temperamental and being in a confined space with 5-8 loud guests. Fred does not mind letting
his friends play songs during the trip as long as it is something that he feels will make the trip go smoothly. He
has an idea of what friends have what tastes but he doesn't really have time to filter the songs since he has to keep
his eyes on the road.

**Greg** is a musician that produces samples and short jingles for advertisements. He knows that sometimes it is better
to get input from outside sources when looking for inspiration so he usually invites his friends to his house so that
they can play songs that would "go well" with the product he is trying to sell. Greg obviously has some sort of idea
of what he would like to do for the song, which is why he doesn't like wasting time listening to songs that he already
knows would not work at all. His friends usually load up the queue pretty fast since they just put in anything that
they come up with. With this in mind, Greg wants to be able to remove some songs in order to have more time to listen
to the ones that could potentially inspire him.
