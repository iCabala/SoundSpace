##[Festify](http://getfestify.com/) 
Festify is an app which allows people at a party to use their smartphone to vote on which songs will be played. It is powered by the Spotify music streaming service.

It is similar to our project in that it allows its users to collaborate on a music playlist. However, it differs from our idea in the following ways:
  * Our project will not depend on a streaming service. This allows users to play whichever music they can supply, which may not exist in Spotify's library. Their own music may also be DRM free and of higher quality. Given the controversial nature of DRM and artists' compensation from streaming services, this is a significant advantage as users are able to play and share the music they own. 
  * This project does not depend on an internet connection (and would not use up any bandwidth).
  * Different playlist or vote algorithms, such as letting the users take turns choosing songs or giving everyone a certain number of points to spend when voting would let users create dynamic playlists appropriate for their situation.
  * If we move past our MVP, our service will allow users to copy music from their own device to the host or vice versa.
  * Depending on which platform we decide on, our interface may be more user-friendly and flexible than the web-based interface of Festify.
  
##The manual way
People at a party take turns plugging their phones into the speakers and playing whatever music they want. Consensus among those with differing tastes is poor. Squabbles occur over who gets to play music. People hog the speakers for extended periods of time without letting others choose what will be played. Impossible to coordinate when there are many people at the event. May lead to drunken fistfights.
