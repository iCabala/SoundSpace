Team 5 Project Summary
=======
Project Objective
-------
The purpose of this project is to create a music sharing and organization product that can be used by multiple users within real physical environments. The platform choice rests between Android and web-based, currently still open to debate.

The application enables users to connect to each other wirelessly, and construct a music playlist collectively, to play over one host device, with each item being selected with a vote after being suggested by one user. List order, switching to another song immediately and deletion are similarly decided as majority.

Key Personas
-------
Some of the key personas are listed below, selected for the likelihood of their needs being crucial for a MVP: 

**Alice** is a party host that delegates the music selection to her guests.

**Brandon** likes to let his friends pick order of the songs he plays for them.

**Fred** is picky, and would like to let only some of his friends decide on song selection.

**Greg** would like his collegues to be able to remove songs.

Key Scenarios
-------

Alice is throwing a small dinner party and needs to put together a playlist of classical music as a last-minute thought. She likes Bach but does not know of enough quartets to select to entertain her guests. She asks for everyone to chip in with their favourite movements on the application to create a playlist of several hours.

Greg has opened the playlist on his application for the critique of his co-workers, who are more music-savvy than him. He wants to eliminate the majority of the items on his saved list, leaving behind only what's "hip" and well-liked.

Brandon is in a private gym with his workout buddies, and he wants them to re-organize his playlist of high-octane songs in an increasing tempo so that they can be motivated better.

Key Principles
-------

**Ease of use over attractive features** : Application will be kept simple in interaction and interface.

**User participation over resource availability** : Multiple users' interaction is more important than having access to more songs.

**Easy deployment over platform availability** : MVP must be on a platform we can deploy the easiest, rather than the one that is likely to sell most.
