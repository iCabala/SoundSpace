## Organizational Tools

Soon after forming our team, we decided to use [**Slack**](https://slack.com/) as our primary tool to organize ourselves, and have group-wide communication. We realized that using Slack -- an online tool built for team collaboration -- would prove to be an excellent option, especially given the size of our team. Having six people (each with busy university schedules) meet in-person on a daily basis is not feasible; as such, Slack is an excellent solution that offers both flexibility with regards to team members' availabilities, as well as the communication benefits of in-person meetings. That it can be used on a variety of platforms (web, mobile), and in any location with an internet connection is a bonus.

Additionally, we used **Google Hangouts** to communicate -- as a group -- with our assigned TA, Spandan. This remains the most viable audio/video-based online mode of communication.

## Meetings, Communication, and Decisions

Due to the ease and robustness of Slack, we found that we did not need to have in-person meetings, and could communicate effectively and smoothly online. 

**All decisions were made as a group**, after extensive discussion on Slack. One example was when we were choosing our project idea: multiple people had strong ideas, so we collectively looked at each idea, had fruitful discussions, and only then went ahead with our final, music organization idea. In fact, our eventual decision was unanimous.

Another [ongoing] discussion we had was the target platform for this product. Each group member talked of their proficiency with Android and web apps (the platforms currently on the table), which will be factored into our final decision. Once again, we will only move forward with the optimum option, given **all members' points of view**.

## Development of the Idea, Personas, and User Stories

Our understanding of the idea also developed and enhanced as we continually bounced ideas off each other. This is how our user stories and personas became more refined. All of us talked about the various benefits of such a product, and from there, our **key personas** developed rather fluidly. Similarly, through back-and-forths between ourselves, our **user stories** became clearer, and we naturally moved towards a clearer product vision, which helped us define the more important objectives, and the relative difficulty of each.

## Lessons for the Next Phase

One of the most important things that we, as a group, have learnt is the importance of having a clear, **concrete plan of action**. Even if our idea is not yet set in stone, we have learnt a lot about the way in which we have to approach this problem, and understand the commitment and effort required of us. This is already something we have begun implementing, as we have commenced discussions on how to move forward, early in this next phase.

We have also had to come to terms with the organizational aspect of this project -- not all of us have worked in a six-person group that does not meet on a regular basis before. Because of this, we have learnt that we must always keep the **lines of communication** open, lest one or more of us fall behind or don't deliver what is expected. This is perhaps the most important lesson we take with us to the next phase, and is something that will serve us immensely in the coming weeks.
