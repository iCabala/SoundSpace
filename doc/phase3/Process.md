##Process

**Describe your process**

The group organizes itself by following the rough work division outlines the group members discussed previously: members who began putting together the server functionality and back-end continue with back-end tasks, while people who expressed interest in the front end and UI/UX design generate and tackle tasks in their domain. Communication is initiated between members of the different groups when one group requires the implementation of functionalities under the domain of the other group in order to complete their own tasks.
Group members have also gathered for in-person development sessions, which have resulted in faster communication and producing faster results.

**Tools**

The primary communication tool continues to be Slack. Group members pose questions and suggestions on Slack for different tasks and problems that needs solving, and a member takes on the solution after collaboration. Hangout calls were also used with screen-share tools to walk other members through the code if there was any confusion over different snippets. Beyond these tools, GitHub issues have been used more effectively - they were more numerous and far more specific than before.

**Change in process**

The group has followed a slightly different approach from the process that was defined in Phase 2. The most significant difference was the lack of scrum meetings. Instead, there was a shift towards informing the group which specific tasks each member was working on or had completed on the Slack channel, with member-to-member messages sent for clarifying issues in coupled areas of code.

A second version of a backlog was used to identify more specific tasks, a document that was kept up to date with different design decisions and cut-off features for the project. It can be found in this phase's documents folder or [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2015/project-team5-L0101/blob/master/doc/phase3/backlog.md).

One group development session and meeting was conducted on 11/19 in BA3200. For the first 2 hours, back-end and server functionality were worked on, adaptation to mongodb database rather than using JSON files were discussed. Design changes for merging room/playlist functionality was made. For the last three hours, front-end and GUI was worked on, hmtl files were merged, and physical design aspects of the GUI was discussed along with changing the UX design to eliminate unnecessary extra steps users must go through to navigate the app.

Issues were used more frequently this time, with much more specific written tasks for each issue. Issues opened in this phase can be seen [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2015/project-team5-L0101/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E2015-11-18+) with closed issues [here](https://github.com/csc301-fall-2015/project-team5-L0101/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E2015-11-18+is%3Aclosed). Some individual progress can be seen here in form of issues as well.

Another change has been the usage of individual issues for task sizing and the burndown chart. Since each issue was highly specific and described one task, the burndown chart has been generated based on the number of issues created. The current group burndown chart, as of 11/22 5:47pm can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/QuXhyCT.png)

**Rationale**

The primary decision about the organization was the abandonment of the daily scrum meetings. Having members  busy with different courses, having different schedules and available working time on the project, meetings were not very fruitful in terms of putting each person on the spot for their previously taken responsibilities. Instead, more effective progress was made by having everyone report their progress on Slack on their own time.

More emphasis was placed on using issues effectively since the group previously had difficulties keeping a tangible track of what each person had worked on.
